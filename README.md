## About

**Guess the Number** is a browser-based game where players try to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. The game provides real-time feedback if the guess is too high or too low, keeps track of previous attempts, and allows the player to restart at any time. This project demonstrates structured JavaScript logic, DOM manipulation, and responsive, BEM-styled CSS without external libraries.
